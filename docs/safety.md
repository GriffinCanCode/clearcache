# Safety Systems

ClearCache implements comprehensive safety mechanisms to prevent accidental deletion of critical files and system components. The multi-layered approach ensures reliable operation across diverse development environments while maintaining high performance. The system features dual operation modes: Safe Mode (default) for temporary caches and Library Mode for comprehensive cleaning including dependencies.

## Safety Philosophy

### Defense in Depth

The system employs multiple independent validation layers, ensuring that even if one protection mechanism fails, others will prevent dangerous operations. Each layer operates on different criteria and uses distinct validation approaches.

### Conservative by Default

All safety decisions err on the side of caution. When uncertain about file safety, the system excludes files from deletion rather than risking data loss. This approach prioritizes data integrity over aggressive cache cleaning. The default Safe Mode further enhances safety by excluding libraries that require reinstallation.

### Context-Aware Validation

Safety mechanisms consider both file properties and environmental context. A file that might be safe to delete in one context could be critical in another, and the validation system accounts for these differences.

## Dual-Mode Safety System

### Safe Mode (Default)

**Automatic Activation**: Safe Mode is the default operation mode, requiring no additional flags.

**Library Protection**: Automatically excludes dependencies requiring reinstallation:
- Node.js `node_modules` directories
- Rust `target` directories
- Go `pkg/mod` module caches

**Safe Cache Targeting**: Only processes temporary caches that regenerate automatically:
- Build artifacts and temporary files
- Bytecode caches
- Development tool caches
- Log files and temporary directories

**Benefits**:
- No reinstallation required after cleaning
- Safe for automated scripts and CI/CD
- Fast execution without dependency rebuilding
- Preserves development environment setup

### Library Mode

**Explicit Activation**: Requires `--include-libraries` or `-l` flag.

**Comprehensive Cleaning**: Includes both safe caches and libraries requiring reinstallation.

**Clear Indication**: Library items are marked with `[LIBRARY]` indicator in output.

**Use Cases**:
- Deep cleaning before project archival
- Resolving dependency conflicts  
- Maximum space recovery
- Environment reset and troubleshooting

## Primary Safety Layers

### System Path Protection

**Critical Directory Blacklist**: Absolute protection for essential system directories including root filesystem paths, system binaries, libraries, and user home directories.

**Protected Paths**:
- Unix: `/`, `/usr`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/home`, `/root`, `/boot`, `/dev`, `/proc`, `/sys`
- macOS: `/Library`, `/System`, `/Applications`, `/Users`, `/Volumes`
- Windows: `C:\`, `C:\Windows`, `C:\Program Files`, `C:\Program Files (x86)`, `C:\Users`

**Implementation**: Path normalization and exact matching against protected path list with case-insensitive comparison on Windows systems.

### Depth-Based Protection

**Minimum Depth Requirement**: Prevents deletion of files too close to filesystem root. Files must be at least 3 directory levels deep from root to be considered for deletion.

**Rationale**: Critical system files and user data typically reside in shallow directory structures. This protection prevents accidental deletion of top-level directories.

**Exception Handling**: Explicitly whitelisted cache directories can override depth restrictions when located in known safe contexts.

### Content-Based Validation

**Important File Detection**: Scans directories for files that indicate active development projects rather than pure cache storage.

**Important File Indicators**:
- Source code entry points: `main.rs`, `lib.rs`, `index.js`, `app.py`
- Project configuration: `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`
- Build configuration: `Makefile`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `build.gradle`
- Documentation: `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- Version control: `.git`, `.svn`, `.hg` directories

**Validation Logic**: If any important files are detected within a target directory, the entire directory is excluded from deletion to prevent accidental removal of active projects.

### Pattern-Based Safety

**Conservative Pattern Matching**: Cache patterns are designed to be highly specific, avoiding broad matches that could inadvertently target non-cache files.

**Pattern Validation**:
- Exact directory name matching for well-known cache directories
- File extension matching with multiple validation criteria
- Context-aware pattern application based on project type detection

**False Positive Prevention**: Multiple pattern criteria must match before a file is considered for deletion, reducing the risk of false positive matches.

## Advanced Safety Mechanisms

### Heuristic Analysis

**Directory Structure Analysis**: Examines directory organization patterns to distinguish between genuine cache directories and user-created directories with similar names.

**Size and Age Heuristics**: Considers file size distributions and modification times to identify cache-like characteristics versus user data patterns.

**Content Sampling**: For uncertain cases, performs limited content analysis to distinguish between generated cache files and user-created content.

### Git Integration

**Repository Awareness**: Detects Git repositories and applies additional safety measures within version-controlled directories.

**Gitignore Respect**: Considers `.gitignore` patterns as additional safety indicators, avoiding deletion of files that are explicitly tracked or important to the project.

**Submodule Protection**: Identifies and protects Git submodules from accidental deletion, even when they contain cache-like directory names.

### Cross-Platform Considerations

**Case Sensitivity Handling**: Properly handles case-insensitive filesystems on Windows and macOS while maintaining case-sensitive behavior on Unix systems.

**Path Separator Normalization**: Converts path separators to platform-appropriate formats while maintaining consistent internal representation.

**Unicode Path Support**: Correctly handles international characters in file paths across all supported platforms.

## Safety Validation Pipeline

### Pre-Processing Validation

**Path Sanitization**: Normalizes and validates all input paths before processing begins.

**Permission Verification**: Ensures the system has appropriate permissions for target operations without compromising system security.

**Disk Space Checks**: Validates sufficient disk space for safe operation and temporary file creation if needed.

### Runtime Validation

**Real-Time Path Checking**: Validates each target path immediately before deletion operation.

**Concurrent Access Detection**: Identifies files that may be in use by other processes and excludes them from deletion.

**Symbolic Link Handling**: Carefully manages symbolic links to prevent unintended deletion of link targets.

### Post-Processing Verification

**Operation Confirmation**: Verifies that only intended files were affected by deletion operations.

**Error Analysis**: Analyzes any operation failures to distinguish between expected permission issues and potential safety violations.

**Audit Trail Generation**: Creates detailed logs of all operations for post-operation review and debugging.

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Graceful Failure Modes

**Individual Operation Isolation**: Failure of individual file operations does not terminate the entire cleaning process.

**Error Classification**: Distinguishes between safety violations, permission errors, and transient failures with appropriate handling for each.

**Recovery Strategies**: Implements retry logic for transient failures while immediately aborting for safety violations.

### Safety Violation Response

**Immediate Termination**: Safety violations result in immediate termination of the operation with detailed error reporting.

**Context Preservation**: Maintains detailed information about the violation for user review and system improvement.

**User Notification**: Provides clear, actionable error messages that explain the safety concern and suggest appropriate actions.

## Configuration and Customization

### Safety Level Configuration

**Conservative Mode**: Maximum safety with additional validation layers and stricter criteria for cache identification.

**Standard Mode**: Balanced approach suitable for most development environments with comprehensive protection.

**Aggressive Mode**: Reduced safety margins for experienced users in controlled environments (not recommended for general use).

## Integration with Ignore System

### Complementary Protection Layers

**Multi-Layer Defense**: The safety systems work in conjunction with the `.clearcacheignore` system to provide comprehensive protection through multiple independent mechanisms.

**Hierarchical Safety**: Built-in safety mechanisms provide foundational protection that cannot be overridden, while ignore files enable user-customizable additional protection for project-specific needs.

**Pattern Validation**: Ignore patterns are processed alongside safety validation to ensure that user-defined exclusions complement rather than compromise the built-in safety mechanisms.

### Ignore System Integration

**Safety-First Processing**: Safety validation occurs before ignore pattern processing to ensure critical system protection is never bypassed.

**Enhanced Customization**: Users can protect additional directories and files beyond the built-in safety mechanisms through `.clearcacheignore` files.

**Team Collaboration**: Shared ignore files enable teams to establish consistent protection standards while maintaining individual safety guarantees.

**Performance Optimization**: Ignore patterns enable early termination of directory traversal, improving performance while maintaining safety through reduced filesystem access.
