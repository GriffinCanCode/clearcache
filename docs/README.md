# ClearCache Technical Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive technical documentation for the ClearCache system. The documentation is organized to serve both developers seeking to understand the implementation and consumers evaluating the system's capabilities.

## Document Structure

### [Architecture Overview](architecture.md)
Detailed examination of the system's architectural decisions, component relationships, and design patterns. Covers the modular structure, data flow, and key abstractions that enable high-performance cache management.

### [Technology Stack](tech-stack.md)
Analysis of technology choices including Rust language selection, dependency rationale, and performance considerations. Explains why specific libraries and approaches were chosen over alternatives.

### [Performance Analysis](performance.md)
Comprehensive performance evaluation including benchmarking methodology, comparative analysis against alternative implementations, and scalability characteristics across different workloads.

### [Safety Systems](safety.md)
Documentation of the multi-layered safety mechanisms that prevent accidental deletion of critical files. Covers path validation, content analysis, protective heuristics, and the dual-mode system (Safe Mode vs Library Mode).

### [Cache Type System](cache-types.md)
Technical specification of the cache pattern matching system, ecosystem-specific implementations, library classification system, and the extensible framework for supporting additional cache types. Includes detailed coverage of Safe Mode vs Library Mode operation.

### [ClearCache Ignore System](clearcacheignore.md)
Comprehensive guide to the `.clearcacheignore` system that provides gitignore-compatible pattern matching for excluding directories and files from cache cleaning operations. Covers syntax, usage patterns, performance considerations, and integration with safety systems.

## Target Audience

**System Administrators**: Focus on performance characteristics, safety guarantees, and operational considerations.

**Software Developers**: Emphasis on architectural decisions, implementation patterns, and integration possibilities.

**Performance Engineers**: Detailed benchmarking data, scalability analysis, and optimization techniques.

**Security Analysts**: Safety mechanisms, validation procedures, and risk mitigation strategies.

## Reading Guide

For a complete technical understanding, read documents in the following order:

1. Architecture Overview - Establishes foundational concepts
2. Technology Stack - Provides context for implementation choices  
3. Cache Type System - Explains core functionality
4. Safety Systems - Details protective mechanisms
5. Performance Analysis - Quantifies system capabilities

Each document is designed to be self-contained while building upon concepts introduced in earlier sections.
